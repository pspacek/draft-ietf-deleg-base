                     Extensible Delegation for DNS
                        draft-ietf-deleg-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes a new extensible method for delegation of the
   authority for a domain in Domain Name System (DNS) based in DELEG and
   DELEGI records.

   A delegation in the DNS is a mechanism that enables efficient and
   distributed management of the DNS namespace.  The traditional DNS
   delegation is based on NS records which contain only hostname of a
   server and no other parameters.  New delegation records are
   extensible, can be secured with DNSSEC, and eliminate parent-child
   duplication from the DNS.

1.  Introduction

   In the Domain Name System, responsibility for each subdomain within
   the domain name hierarchy can be delegated to different servers,
   which makes them authoritative for their portion of the namespace.

   The original DNS record that does this, called NS record, contains
   only hostname of a single nameserver and no other parameters.  The
   resolver needs to resolve these names into usable addresses and infer
   other required parameters, such as transport protocol and any other
   protocol features.  Moreover the NS record exists in two copies, at
   the delegation point, and in the child zone.  DNS Security Extension
   (DNSSEC) protect only one copy, in the child zone.

   These properties of NS records limit resolvers to unencrypted UDP and
   TCP port 53, and this initial contact cannot be protected with
   DNSSEC.  Even if these two problems were somehow solved, NS record
   does not offer extensibility for any other parameters.  This
   limitation is a barrier for efficient introduction of new DNS
   technology.

   The proposed DELEG and DELEGI record types remedy this problem by
   providing extensible parameters to indicate server capabilities and
   additional information, such as addresses that a resolver may use to
   reach the server.  The DELEG record creates a new delegation.  It is
   authoritative in the parent side of delegation and thus signed.  This
   makes it possible to validate all delegation parameters with DNSSEC,
   including all future extensions.

   The DELEGI record is an auxiliary record which does not create
   delegation by itself but provides an optional layer of indirection.
   It can be used to share the same delegation information across any
   number of zones.  DELEGI is treated like regular authoritative
   record.

   DELEG record can be used instead of or along side a NS record to
   create a delegation.  Combination of DELEG+NS is fully compatible
   with old resolvers.

   Future documents can use the extensible mechanism for more advanced
   features like connecting to a name server with an encrypted
   transport.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Terminology regarding the Domain Name System comes from [BCP219],
   with addition terms defined here:

   *  legacy delegation: A delegation that is done with an NS RRset

   *  legacy response: A response which does not take (new) special
      semantics of DELEG RRtype into account

   *  legacy referral response: A response with an NS RRset in the
      AUTHORITY section, plus all relevant DNSSEC records

   *  legacy resolver: A resolver which does not follow the DELEG
      protocol

   *  DELEG-aware: An authoritative server or resolver that follows the
      protocol defined in this document

   *  DELEG-unaware: An authoritative server or resolver that does not
      (yet) follow the protocol defined in this document

2.  DELEG and DELEGI Record Types

   The DELEG record (whose RRtype is TBD1) and the DELEGI record (whose
   RRtype is TBD2, different than that of DELEG) have the same wire and
   presentation formats, but their semantics are different.

   TODO: Decide about class: IN or class independent?  SVCB is IN-
   specific.

   The record format is based on the extensible key=value list that was
   originally defined for "SvcParams" for the SVCB record type
   [RFC9460].  Unlike SVCB, DELEG protocol does not have "SvcPriority"
   and "TargetName" fields.  The keys in the DELEG protocol are
   different than those used in SVCB.  To avoid confusion between the
   two protocols, the list of key=value parameters used by the DELEG
   protocol are called DelegInfos.

   The following rules are adapted from SVCB, but with changed names:

   *  The whole RDATA consists of a single list called "DelegInfos".

   *  DelegInfos consists of individual DelegInfo key=value pairs.

   *  Each DelegInfo pair has DelegInfoKey and a (possibly optional)
      DelegInfoValue.

   *  Each DelegInfo has a specified presentation format and wire
      encoding.

   *  Each DelegInfoKey has a presentation name and a registered key
      number.

   *  Each DelegInfoValue is in a format specific to its DelegInfoKey.

   Implementations can reuse the same code to parse SvcParams and
   DelegInfos and only plug in a different list of key=value pairs for
   SVCB/HTTPS and DELEG/DELEGI record families.

   The initial set of DelegInfoKeys and their formats are defined in
   Section 3.1.5.

2.1.  Presentation Format

   The RDATA presentation format of the record consists of a single
   list: DelegInfos

   The DelegInfos presentation format is defined exactly same as
   "SvcParams" defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC9460].  The following rules
   are adapted from SVCB, but with changed names:

   *  DelegInfos is a whitespace-separated list with each DelegInfo
      consisting of a DelegInfoKey=DelegInfoValue pair, or a standalone
      DelegInfoKey.

   *  Individual element definitions are the same as [RFC9460]:

      -  The DelegInfo syntax is the same as SvcParam, but it references
         DelegInfo elements instead of SvcParam elements.

      -  DelegInfoKey syntax is the same as SvcParamKey.

      -  The syntax for unknown keys in Section 2.1 of [RFC9460]
         applies.

      -  The DelegInfoValue syntax is the same as SvcParamValue.

      -  The rules from Appendix A of [RFC9460] apply.

   *  All the requirements in Section 2.1 of [RFC9460] apply.

   TODO: SVCB allows an empty list.  I guess it is not a problem, it is
   small and will be simply ignored?

2.2.  RDATA Wire Format

   The format of the DelegInfos list is identical to SvcParams format
   defined in Section 2.2 [RFC9460], including the requirements for
   strictly increasing numeric order of keys and duplicate keys not
   being allowed.

   All the requirements in Section 2.2 of [RFC9460] apply.

2.3.  Overview of Differences between DELEG and DELEGI Semantics

   The following is a brief summary of semantic differences between the
   DELEG and DELEGI types.

   *  DELEG creates a delegation for its owner name, similar to the NS
      RRtype.

   *  DELEG and NS RRtypes can coexist at the same owner name.

   *  DELEG is authoritative in the parent zone of the delegated zone,
      similar to the DS RRtype (but unlike the NS RRtype).

   *  DELEG is signed by the parent zone of the delegated zone, similar
      to the DS RRtype (and unlike the NS RRtype).

   *  DELEG is cannot be present at the apex of a child side of the
      delegation, similar to the DS RRtype (and unlike the NS RRtype).

   *  DELEG has unique rules for inclusion in answers, as described in
      many parts of this specification.

   *  DELEGI is like any normal RR, as is doesn't require any special
      processing.

   *  DELEGI does not create a delegation for its owner name.

   *  DELEGI cannot coexist at the same owner name with DELEG or NS
      RRtypes.

   *  DELEGI DNSSEC signing and record placement rules are the same as
      for any ordinary RRtype.

   *  DELEGI is used as the target of the DELEG protocol's "include"
      mechanism (see section Section 3.1.6 for details).

   TODO: Add some introduction comparing how resolvers see legacy
   delegation (set of NS and A/AAAA records) and DELEG delegation (DELEG
   and DELEGI records with server-ipv4 and server-ipv6 keys)

3.  Use of DELEG Records

   A DELEG RRset MAY be present at a delegation point.  The DELEG RRset
   MAY contain multiple records.  DELEG RRsets MUST NOT appear at a
   zone's apex.

   A DELEG RRset MAY be present with or without NS or DS RRsets at the
   delegation point.

3.1.  Resolvers

3.1.1.  Signaling DELEG Support

   There will be both DELEG and NS needed for delegation for a long
   time.  Both legacy delegation and the DELEG protocol enable recursive
   resolution.  This document defines a new EDNS flag to signal that a
   resolver is DELEG-aware and therefore does not need NS records or
   glue information in a referral response.

   A resolver that is DELEG-aware MUST signal that it supports the DELEG
   protocol by sending the DE bit when sending queries.  This bit is
   referred to as the "DELEG" (DE) bit.  In the context of the EDNS0 OPT
   meta-RR, the DE bit is the TBD of the "extended RCODE and flags"
   portion of the EDNS0 OPT meta-RR, structured as follows (to be
   updated when assigned):

               +0 (MSB)                +1 (LSB)
        +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
     0: |   EXTENDED-RCODE      |       VERSION         |
        +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
     2: |DO|CO|DE|              Z                       |
        +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   Setting the DE bit to one in a query indicates the resolver
   understands new DELEG semantics and does not need NS records to
   follow a referral.  The DE bit set to 0 indicates the resolver is not
   DELEG-aware, and therefore can only be served referrals with NS
   records and other data according to pre-DELEG specifications.

3.1.2.  Referral

   The DELEG record creates a zone cut similar to the NS record.

   If one or more DELEG records exist at a given delegation point, a
   DELEG-aware resolver MUST treat the name servers from those DELEG
   records as authoritative for the child zone.  In such case, a DELEG-
   aware resolver MUST NOT use NS records even if they happen to be
   present in cache, even if resolution using DELEG records have failed
   for any reason.  Such fallback from DELEG to NS would invalidate
   security guarantees of DELEG protocol.

   If no DELEG record exists at a given delegation point, DELEG-aware
   resolvers MUST use NS records as specified by [RFC1034].  See
   Section 3.4 for more information about protection from downgrade
   attacks.

3.1.3.  Parent-side types, QTYPE=DELEG

   Record types defined as authoritative on the parent side of zone cut
   (currently DS and DELEG types) retain the same special handling as
   described in Section 2.6 of [RFC4035].

   DELEG-unaware resolvers can get different types of answers for
   QTYPE=DELEG queries based on the configuration of the server, such as
   whether it is DELEG-aware and whether it also is authoritative for
   subdomains.

3.1.4.  Algorithm for "Finding the Best Servers to Ask"

   This document updates instructions for finding the best servers to
   ask.  That information currently is covered in Section 5.3.3 of
   [RFC1034] and Section 3.4.1 of [RFC6672] with the text "2.  Find the
   best servers to ask."  Section 3.1.4.1 of [RFC4035] should have
   explicitly updated Section 5.3.3 of [RFC1034] for the DS RRtype, but
   failed to do so.  This document simply extends this existing behavior
   to DELEG RRtype as well, and makes this special case explicit.

   When a DELEG RRset exists in a zone, DELEG-aware resolvers ignore the
   NS RRset for that zone.  This means that the DELEG-aware resolver
   ignores the NS RRset in the zone's parent as well as any cached NS
   RRset that the resolver might have gotten by looking in the apex of
   the zone.

   Each delegation level can have a mixture of DELEG and NS RRtypes, and
   DELEG-aware resolvers MUST be able to follow chains of delegations
   which combines both types in arbitrary ways.

   An example of a valid delegation tree:

   ; root zone with NS-only delegations
   . SOA ...
   test. NS ...

   ; test. zone with NS+DELEG delegations
   test. SOA ...
   sld.test. NS ...
   sld.test. DELEG ...

   ; sld.test. zone with NS-only delegation
   sld.test. SOA ...
   nssub.sld.test. NS ...

   ; nssub.sld.test. zone with DELEG-only delegation
   delegsub.sub.sld.test. DELEG ...

   TODO: after the text below, refer back to this figure and show the
   order that a DELEG-aware resolver would take when there is a failure
   to find any good DELEG addresses at sub.sld.test, then any usable
   nameservers at sub.sld.test, and then maybe a good DELEG record at
   test.

   The terms SNAME and SLIST used here are defined in Section 5.3.2 of
   [RFC1034]:

   SNAME is the domain name we are searching for.

   SLIST is a structure which describes the name servers and the zone
   which the resolver is currently trying to query.  Neither [RFC1034]
   nor this document define how a resolver uses SLIST; they only define
   how to populate it.

   A DELEG-aware SLIST needs to be able to hold two types of
   information: delegations defined by NS records and delegations
   defined by DELEG records.  DELEG and NS delegations can create cyclic
   dependencies and/or lead to duplicate entries which point to the same
   server.  Resolvers need to enforce suitable limits to prevent damage
   even if someone has incorrectly configured some of the data used to
   create an SLIST.

   This leads to a modifications of the description from earlier
   documents for DELEG-aware resolvers can find the best servers to ask.
   That description becomes:

   1.  Determine deepest possible zone cut which can potentially hold
       the answer for given (query name, type, class) combination:

       1.  Start with SNAME equal to QNAME.

       2.  If QTYPE is a type that is authoritative at the parent side
           of a zone cut (currently, DS or DELEG), remove the leftmost
           label from SNAME.  For example, if the QNAME is
           "test.example." and the QTYPE is DELEG or DS, set SNAME to
           "example.".

   2.  Look for locally-available DELEG and NS RRsets, starting at
       current SNAME.

       1.  For given SNAME, check for existence of a DELEG RRset.  If it
           exists, the resolver MUST use its content to populate SLIST.
           However, if the DELEG RRset is known to exist but is unusable
           (for example, if it is found in DNSSEC BAD cache), the
           resolver MUST NOT instead use an NS RRset, even if it is
           locally available; instead, the resolver MUST treat this case
           as if no servers were available.

       2.  If a given SNAME is proven to not have a DELEG RRset but does
           have NS RRset, the resolver MUST copy the NS RRset into
           SLIST.

       3.  If SLIST is now populated, stop walking up the DNS tree.
           However, if SLIST is not populated, remove leftmost label
           from SNAME and go back to the first step, using the new
           (shortened) SNAME.  Do not go back to the first step if doing
           so would exceed the amount of work that the resolver is
           configured to do when processing names; see Section 4.1.

   The rest of the Step 2's description is not affected by this
   document.

   TODO: Determine what to do about ".  DELEG" or ".  DS" queries, which
   by definition do not have answers in the zone.

3.1.5.  Nameserver Information for Delegation

   The DELEG and DELEGI records have four keys that describe information
   about nameservers.  The purpose of this information is to populate
   the SLIST with IP addresses of the nameservers for a zone.  The types
   of information defined in this document are:

   *  server-ipv4: a set of IPv4 addresses for nameservers

   *  server-ipv6: a set of IPv6 addresses for nameservers

   *  server-name: the domain name of a nameserver; the addresses must
      be fetched

   *  include-delegi: the domain name that points to a DELEGI RRset,
      which in turn has more information about the nameservers

   The presentation values for server-ipv4 and server-ipv6 are comma-
   separated list of one or more IP addresses of the appropriate family
   in standard textual format [RFC5952] [RFC4001].  The wire formats for
   server-ipv4 and server-ipv6 are a sequence of IP addresses in network
   byte order (for the respective address family).

   The presentation values for server-name and include-delegi are as
   sets of full-qualified domain names, separated by commas.  The wire
   format for server-name and include-delegi are each a concatenated set
   of a wire-format domain names.  The names in the wire format MUST NOT
   be compressed.

   TODO: Are they?  Are we going to forbid normal zone file expansion
   where names without trailing . get current origin appended to them?

   If any one of these keys is used, it MUST have a value (that is, it
   cannot be a key with a zero-length value).

   A DELEG or DELEGI record MUST NOT have more than one set of server
   information, chosen from the following:

   *  one server-ipv4 key

   *  one server-ipv6 key

   *  a pair consisting of one server-ipv4 and one server-ipv6

   *  one server-name key

   *  one include-delegi key

   This restriction only applies to a single DELEG or DELEGI record; a
   DELEG or DELEGI RRset can have records with different server
   information keys.

   When using server-name, the addresses for all the names in the set
   must be fetched using normal DNS resolution.  This means the names in
   the value of the server-name key or the include-delegi key MUST NOT
   be inside the delegated domain.

3.1.6.  Populating the SLIST from DELEG and DELEGI Records

   Each individual DELEG record inside a DELEG RRset, or each individual
   DELEGI record in a DELEGI RRset, can cause the addition of zero or
   more entries to SLIST.

   A resolver processes each individual DELEG record within a DELEG
   RRset, or each individual DELEGI record in a DELEGI RRset, using the
   following steps:

   1.  If a record has more than one type of server information keys, or
       has multiple server information keys of the same type, that
       record is malformed.  Stop processing this record.

   2.  If one or more server-ipv4 or server-ipv6 keys are present inside
       the record, copy all the address values from the server-ipv4 or
       server-ipv6 fields in the record into SLIST.  Stop processing
       this record.

   3.  If a server-name key is present in the record, resolve each name
       in the value into addresses.  Copy these addresses into SLIST.
       Stop processing this record.

   4.  If a include-delegi key is present in the record, resolve each
       name in the value using the DELEGI RRtype.  Recursively apply the
       algorithm described in this section, after checking that the
       maximum loop count described in Section 4.1 has not been reached.

   5.  If none of the above applies, SLIST is not modified by this
       particular record.

   A DELEG-aware resolver MAY implement lazy filling of SLIST, such as
   by deferring processing remaining records if SLIST already has what
   the resolver considers a sufficiently large pool of addresses to
   contact.

3.2.  Authoritative Servers

   DELEG-aware authoritative servers act differently when handling
   queries from DELEG-unaware clients (those with DE=0) than from DELEG-
   aware clients (those with DE=1).

   The server MUST copy the value of the DE bit from the query into the
   response.

3.2.1.  DELEG-unaware Clients

   DELEG-unaware clients do not use DELEG records for delegation.  When
   a DELEG-aware authoritative server responds to a DELEG-unaware
   client, any DELEG record in the response does not create a zone cut,
   is not returned in referral responses, and is not considered
   authoritative on the parent side of a zone cut.  Because of this,
   DELEG-aware authoritative servers MUST answer as if they are DELEG-
   unaware.  Please note this instruction does not affect DNSSEC
   signing, i.e. no special handling for NSEC type bitmap is necessary
   and DELEG RRtype is accurately represented even for DELEG-unaware
   clients.

   Two specific cases of DELEG-aware authoritative responding in DELEG-
   unaware manner are described here.

3.2.1.1.  DELEG-unaware Clients Requesting QTYPE=DELEG

   From the perspective of DELEG-unaware clients, DELEG RRtype does not
   have special semantics and should behave like an old ordinary RR
   type, e.g. TXT.  Thus, queries with DE=0 and QTYPE=DELEG MUST result
   in a normal legacy response.  This would be a legacy referral
   response if there are NS records, or the actual DELEG RR type if the
   owner name does not have NS records.

   TODO: Should we have an example with auth having parent+child zone at
   the same time, and DE=0 QTYPE=DELEG query?

3.2.1.2.  DELEG-unaware Clients with DELEG RRs Present but No NS RRs

   DELEG-unaware clients might ask for a name which belongs to a zone
   delegated only with DELEG RRs (that is, without any NS RRs).  Such
   zone is, by definition, not resolvable for DELEG-unaware clients.  In
   this case, the DELEG record itself cannot create a zone cut, and the
   DELEG-aware authoritative server MUST return a legacy response.

   The legacy response might be confusing for subdomains of zones which
   actually exist because DELEG-aware clients would get a different
   answer, namely a delegation.  An example of a legacy response is in
   Appendix A.3.2.

   The authoritative server is RECOMMENDED to supplement these responses
   to DELEG-unaware resolvers with Extended DNS Error "New Delegation
   Only".

   TODO: debate if WG wants to do explicit SERVFAIL for this case
   instead of "just" EDE.

3.2.2.  DELEG-aware Clients

   When the client indicates that it is DELEG-aware by setting DE=1 in
   the query, DELEG-aware authoritative servers treat DELEG records as
   zone cuts, and the servers are authoritative on parent side of zone
   cut.  This new zone cut has priority over legacy delegation with NS
   RRset.

3.2.2.1.  DELEG-aware Clients Requesting QTYPE=DELEG

   An explicit query for the DELEG RRtype at a delegation point behaves
   much like query for the DS RRtype: the server answers authoritatively
   from the parent zone.  All previous specifications for special
   handling queries with QTYPE=DS apply equally to QTYPE=DELEG.  In
   summary, server either provides an authoritative DELEG RRset or
   proves its non-existence.

3.2.2.2.  Delegation with DELEG

   If the delegation has a DELEG RRset, the authoritative server MUST
   put the DELEG RRset into the Authority section of the referral.  In
   this case, the server MUST NOT include the NS RRset into the
   Authority section.  Presence of the covering RRSIG follows the normal
   DNSSEC specification for answers with authoritative zone data.

   Similarly, rules for DS RRset inclusion into referrals apply as
   specified by DNSSEC protocol.

3.2.2.3.  DELEG-aware Clients with NS RRs Present but No DELEG RRs

   If the delegation does not have a DELEG RRset, the authoritative
   server MUST put the NS RRset into the authority section of the
   referral.  The absence of the DELEG RRset MUST be proven as specified
   by DNSSEC protocol for authoritative data.

   Similarly, rules for DS RRset inclusion into referrals apply as
   specified by the DNSSEC protocol.  Please note in practice the same
   process and records are used to prove non-existence of DELEG and DS
   RRsets.

3.3.  DNSSEC Signers

   The DELEG record is authoritative on the parent side of a zone cut
   and needs to be signed as such.  Existing rules from DNSSEC
   specification apply.  In summary: for DNSSEC signing, treat the DELEG
   RRtype the same way as the DS RRtype.

   In order to protect validators from downgrade attacks this draft
   introduces a new DNSKEY flag ADT (Authoritative Delegation Types).
   In zones which contain a DELEG RRset, this flag MUST be set to 1 in
   at least one of the DNSKEY records published in the zone.

3.4.  DNSSEC Validators

   DELEG awareness introduces additional requirements on validators.

3.4.1.  Clarifications on Nonexistence Proofs

   This document updates Section 4.1 of [RFC6840] to include "NS or
   DELEG" types in type bitmap as indication of a delegation point, and
   generalizes applicability of ancestor delegation proof to all RRtypes
   that are authoritative at the parent (that is, both DS and DELEG).
   The text in that section is updated as follows:

   An "ancestor delegation" NSEC RR (or NSEC3 RR) is one with:

   *  the NS and/or DELEG bit set,

   *  the Start of Authority (SOA) bit clear, and

   *  a signer field that is shorter than the owner name of the NSEC RR,
      or the original owner name for the NSEC3 RR.

   Ancestor delegation NSEC or NSEC3 RRs MUST NOT be used to assume
   nonexistence of any RRs below that zone cut, which include all RRs at
   that (original) owner name other than types authoritative at the
   parent-side of zone cut (DS and DELEG), and all RRs below that owner
   name regardless of type.

3.4.2.  Insecure Delegation Proofs

   This document updates Section 4.4 of [RFC6840] to include securing
   DELEG records, and explicitly states that Opt-Out is not applicable
   to the DELEG protocol.  The first paragraph of that section is
   updated to read:

   Section 5.2 of [RFC4035] specifies that a validator, when proving a
   delegation is not secure, needs to check for the absence of the DS
   and SOA bits in the NSEC (or NSEC3) type bitmap.  The validator also
   MUST check for the presence of the NS or the DELEG bit in the
   matching NSEC (or NSEC3) RR (proving that there is, indeed, a
   delegation).  Alternately, the validator must make sure that the
   delegation with NS record is covered by an NSEC3 RR with the Opt-Out
   flag set.  Opt-Out is not applicable to DELEG RRtype because DELEG
   records are authoritative at the parent side of a zone cut in the
   same way that DS RRtypes are.

3.4.3.  Referral downgrade protection

   If the zone is "DNSSEC secure", and if any DNSKEY of the zone has ADT
   flag set to 1, a DELEG-aware validator MUST prove the absence of a
   DELEG RRset in referral responses from this particular zone.

   Without this check, an attacker could strip the DELEG RRset from a
   referral response and replace it with an unsigned (and potentially
   malicious) NS RRset.  A referral response with an unsigned NS and
   signed DS RRsets does not require additional proofs of nonexistence
   according to pre-DELEG DNSSEC specification, and it would have been
   accepted as a delegation without DELEG RRset.

3.4.4.  Chaining

   A Validating Stub Resolver that is DELEG-aware has to use a Security-
   Aware Resolver that is DELEG-aware and, if it is behind a forwarder,
   that forwarder has to be security-aware and DELEG-aware as well.

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO: Add more here

4.1.  Preventing Over-work Attacks

   Resolvers MUST prevent situations where accidental misconfiguration
   of zones or malicious attacks cause them to perform too much work
   when resolving.  This document describes two sets of actions that, if
   not controlled, could lead to over-work attacks:

   *  Names with many subdomains can cause walking up the tree to
      populate SLIST (Section 3.1.4) to be burdensome.  To prevent this,
      the resolver SHOULD NOT walk up more than %%TODO: come up with a
      number%% labels in order to contribute to SLIST.

   *  Long chains of include-delegi information (Section 3.1.5), and
      those with circular chains if include-delegi information, can be
      burdensome.  To prevent this, the resolver SHOULD NOT follow more
      than 3 include-delegi chains in an RRset when populating SLIST.
      Note that include-delegi chains can have CNAME steps in them; in
      such a case, a CNAME step is counted the same as a DELEGI step
      when determining when to stop following a chain.

4.2.  Preventing Downgrade Attacks

   During the rollout of the DELEG protocol, the operator of an
   authoritative server can upgrade the server software to be DELEG-
   aware before changing any DNS zones.  Such deployment should work and
   provide DELEG-aware clients with correct DELEG-aware answers.
   However, the deployment will not be protected from downgrade attacks
   against DELEG protocol.

   To protect DNSSEC-secure DNS zones that use DELEG delegations, the
   delegating zone needs to have at least one DNSKEY with the ADT flag
   set to 1.  Failure to set this flag in a DNSKEY record in the zone
   allows an attacker to remove the DELEG RRset from referrals which
   contain the DS RRset, and replace the original signed DELEG RRset
   with an arbitrary unsigned NS set.  Doing so would be a downgrade
   from the strong protection offered by DNSSEC for DELEG.  That is, the
   DELEG protocol when used with upgraded DNSKEY records gives the same
   protection to DELEG that the zone's DS RRset has; without DELEG,
   there are no security guarantees for the legacy NS RRset on the
   parent side of the zone cut.

   Please note that a full DNSKEY rollover is not necessary to achieve
   the downgrade protection for DELEG.  Any single DNSKEY with the ADT
   flag set to 1 is sufficient; the zone can introduce an otherwise
   unused record into the DNSKEY RRset.  This DNSKEY RR can even use an
   unknown signing algorithm and zero-length key material to minimize
   size increase of the DNSKEY RRset.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Changes to Existing Registries

   IANA is requested to allocate the DELEG RR and the DELEGI RR in the
   Resource Record (RR) TYPEs registry, with the meaning of "enhanced
   delegation information" and referencing this document.

   IANA is requested to assign a new bit in the DNSKEY RR Flags registry
   ([RFC4034]) for the ADT bit (N), with the description "Authoritative
   Delegation Types" and referencing this document.  For compatibility
   reasons we request the bit 14 to be used.  This value has been proven
   to work whereas bit 0 was proven to break in practical deployments
   (because of bugs).

   IANA is requested to assign a bit from the EDNS Header Flags registry
   ([RFC6891]), with the abbreviation DE, the description "DELEG
   enabled" and referencing this document.

   IANA is requested to assign a value from the Extended DNS Error Codes
   ([RFC8914]), with the Purpose "New Delegation Only" and referencing
   this document.

5.2.  New Registry for Delegation Information

   IANA is requested to create the "DELEG Delegation Information"
   registry.  This registry defines the namespace for delegation
   information keys, including string representations and numeric key
   values.

5.2.1.  Procedure

   A registration MUST include the following fields:

   Number: Wire-format numeric identifier (range 0-65535) Name: Unique
   presentation name Meaning: A short description Reference: Location of
   specification or registration source Change Controller: Person or
   entity, with contact information if appropriate

   The characters in the registered Name field entry MUST be lowercase
   alphanumeric or "-".  The name MUST NOT start with "key".

   The registration policy for new entries is Expert Review ([RFC8126]).
   The designated expert MUST ensure that the reference is stable and
   publicly available and that it specifies how to convert the
   delegation information's presentation format to wire format.  The
   reference MAY be any individual's Internet-Draft or a document from
   any other source with similar assurances of stability and
   availability.  An entry MAY specify a reference of the form "Same as
   (other key name)" if it uses the same presentation and wire formats
   as an existing key.

   This arrangement supports the development of new parameters while
   ensuring that zone files can be made interoperable.

5.2.2.  Initial Contents

   The "DELEG Delegation Information" registry should be populated with
   the following initial registrations:

   Number:  1
   Name:  server-ipv4
   Meaning:  A set of IPv4 addresses of nameservers
   Reference:  {{nameserver-info}} of this document
   Change Controller:  IETF

   Number:  2
   Name:  server-ipv6
   Meaning:  A set of IPv6 addresses of nameservers
   Reference:  {{nameserver-info}} of this document
   Change Controller:  IETF

   Number:  3
   Name:  server-name
   Meaning:  The fully-qualified domain name of a nameserver
   Reference:  {{nameserver-info}} of this document
   Change Controller:  IETF

   Number:  4
   Name:  include-delegi
   Meaning:  The fully-qualified domain of a DELEGI record
   Reference:  {{nameserver-info}} of this document
   Change Controller:  IETF

   The registration for number 0 is reserved.
   The registration for numbers 65280-65535 is reserved for private use.

5.3.  Temporary Assignments

   This section gives the values that can be used for interoperability
   testing before IANA makes permanent assignments.  The section will be
   removed when IANA makes permanent assignments.

   *  DELEG RRtype code is 65432

   *  DELEGI RRtype code is 65433

   *  DELEG EDNS Flag Bit is 3

   *  DELEG DNSKEY Flag Bit is 14
