--- abstract
A delegation in the Domain Name System (DNS) is a mechanism that enables efficient and distributed management of the DNS namespace. It involves delegating authority over subdomains to specific DNS servers via NS records, allowing for a hierarchical structure and distributing the responsibility for maintaining DNS records.

An NS record contains the hostname of the nameserver for the delegated namespace. Any facilities of that nameserver must be discovered through other mechanisms. This document proposes a new extensible DNS record type, DELEG, for delegation of the authority for a domain. Future documents then can use this mechanism to use additional information about the delegated namespace and the capabilities of authoritative nameservers for the delegated namespace.

# Introduction

In the Domain Name System {{!STD13}}, subdomains within the domain name hierarchy are indicated by delegations to servers which are authoritative for their portion of the namespace.  The DNS records that do this, called NS records, contain hostnames of nameservers, which resolve to addresses.  No other information is available to the resolver. It is limited to connect to the authoritative servers over UDP and TCP port 53. This limitation is a barrier for efficient introduction of new DNS technology.

The proposed DELEG record type remedies this problem by providing extensible parameters to indicate capabilities and additional information, such as glue that a resolver may use for the delegated authority. It is authoritative and thus signed in the parent side of the delegation making it possible to validate all delegation parameters (names and glue records) with DNSSEC.

This document only shows how DELEG can be used instead of or along side a NS record to create a delegation. Future documents can use the extensible mechanism for more advanced features like connecting to a name server with an encrypted transport.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in \\
BCP 14 {{?RFC2119}} {{?RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in
all capitals, as shown here.

Terminology regarding the Domain Name System comes from {{?BCP219}}, with addition terms defined here:

* legacy name servers: An authoritative server that does not support the DELEG record.
* legacy resolvers: A resolver that does not support the DELEG record.

# DELEG Record Type

The DELEG record uses a new resource record type, whose contents are identical to the SVCB record defined in {{?RFC9460}}. For extensions SVCB and DELEG use Service Parameter Keys (SvcParamKeys) and new SvcParamKeys that might be needed also will use the existing IANA Registry.

## Differences from SVCB

* DELEG can only have two priorities 0 indicating INCLUDE and 1 indicating a DIRECT delegation. These terms MUST be used in the presentation format of the DELEG record.
* INCLUDE and DIRECT delegation can be mixed within an RRSet.
* The final INCLUDE target is an SVCB record, though there can be further indirection using CNAME or AliasMode SVCB records.
* There can be multiple INCLUDE DELEG records, but further indirections through SVCB records have to comply with {{?RFC9460}} in that there can be only one AliasMode SVCB record per name.
* In order to not allow unbounded indirection of DELEG records the maximum number of indirections, CNAME or AliasMode SVCB is 4.
* The SVCB IPv4hint and IPv6hint parameters keep their key values of 4 and 6, but the presentation format with DELEG MUST be Glue4 and Glue6.
* Glue4 and Glue6 records when present MUST be used to connect to the delegated name server.
* The target of any DELEG record MUST NOT be '.'
* The target of a DELEG INCLUDE record MUST be outside of the delegated domain.
* The target of a DELEG DIRECT record MUST be a domain below the delegated domain.

# Use of DELEG record

A DELEG RRset MAY be present at a delegation point.  The DELEG RRset MAY contain multiple records. DELEG RRsets MUST NOT appear at a zone's apex.

A DELEG RRset MAY be present with or without NS or DS RRsets at the delegation point.

## Resolvers

### Signaling DELEG support

A resolver that is DELEG aware MUST signal its support by sending the DE bit when iterating.

This bit is referred to as the "DELEG" (DE) bit.  In the context of the EDNS0 OPT meta-RR, the DE bit is the TBD of the "extended RCODE and flags" portion of the EDNS0 OPT meta-RR, structured as follows (to be updated when assigned):

                +0 (MSB)                +1 (LSB)
         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
      0: |   EXTENDED-RCODE      |       VERSION         |
         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
      2: |DO|CO|DE|              Z                       |
         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

Setting the DE bit to one in a query indicates the resolver understands new DELEG semantics and does not need NS RR to follow a referral. The DE bit cleared (set to zero) indicates the resolver is unprepared to handle DELEG and hence can only be served NS, DS and glue in a delegation response.

Motivation: For a long time there will be both DELEG and NS needed for delegation. As both methods should be configured to get to a proper resolution it is not necessary to send both in a referral response. We therefore purpose an EDNS flag to be use similar to the DO Bit for DNSSEC to be used to signal that the sender understands DELEG and does not need NS or glue information in the referral.

### Referral

The DELEG record creates a zone cut similar to the NS record.

If a DELEG record exists on a given delegation point, all record types defined as authoritative in the child zone MUST be resolved using the name servers defined in the DELEG record. In such case resolver MUST NOT use NS records even if they happen to be present in cache, even if resolution using DELEG records have failed for some reason. Such fallback from DELEG to NS would invalidate security guarantees of DELEG protocol.

If no DELEG record exists on a given delegation point resolver MUST use NS records as specified by RFC1034.

### Parent-side types, QTYPE=DELEG

Record types defined as authoritative on the parent side of zone cut (currently DS and DELEG types) retain the same special handling as before, i.e. {{!RFC4035}} section 2.6 applies.

DELEG unaware recursive resolvers will not be able to determine correct NS set for QTYPE=DELEG queries. This is not a bug.

### Algorithm

TODO: Update RFC 1034 sec 4.3.2. Algorithm + RFC 6672 sec 3.4.1. Resolver Algorithm so implementers don't have to construct it in their heads from scratch.


## Authoritative Servers
DELEG aware authoritative servers have to act different when handling DE=0 queries from DELEG unaware clients, and DE=1 queries from DELEG aware clients.

### Unaware clients, DE=0
A query with DE EDNS bit cleared indicates a DELEG unaware client. Such client has no use for DELEG information. In this case DELEG aware authoritative server MUST answer as if it is DELEG unaware.

In summary, in this specific case, DELEG RR does not create zone cut and is not returned in referral responses, and is not considered authoritative on the parent side of a zone cut. DNSSEC signing is unaffected by this instruction, i.e. no special handling for NSEC type bitmap is necessary.

Two corner cases arise if a zone cut contains DELEG RR and server is answering a DE=0 query:

#### QTYPE=DELEG

DE=0 query indicates that for this particular client DELEG RR type is 'not authoritative' on the parent side.

Let zone file for root zone contain following delegation with NS and DELEG records:

    example. NS    ...
    example. DELEG ...

In this specific case, explicit QTYPE=DELEG query will result in referral response generated by following DELEG unaware rules:

    ;; Authority
    example. NS    ...

Other RRs might be included as specified by pre-DELEG protocols.

#### DELEG without NS

DELEG unaware client might ask for a name which belongs to a zone delegated only with DELEG RRs but without any NS RRs. Such zone is, by definition, not resolvable for DELEG unaware client. Following pre-DELEG specification, in this case DELEG RR itself cannot create a zone cut and this can result in surprising response where RCODE=NXDOMAIN is returned, with correct proof of non-existance, for subdomains of such zone which does actually exist for DELEG aware clients.

In this specific case, authoritative server is RECOMMENDED to supplement DELEG unaware response with Extended DNS Error "New Delegation Only".

TODO: debate if WG wants to do explicit SERVFAIL for this case instead of 'just' EDE

### Aware clients, DE=1

DE flag set to one in a query enables DELEG aware behavior in authoritative servers. In summary, the server treats DELEG records create zone cut and are authoritative on parent side of zone cut. This new zone cut type has priority over legacy delegation with NS RRset.

#### QTYPE=DELEG

An explicit query for DELEG RR type at a delegation point behaves much like query for DS RR type: Server answers authortiatively from the parent zone. All previous specifications for special handling QTYPE=DS apply equally to QTYPE=DELEG. In summary, server either provides authoritative DELEG RRset or proves non-existence of it.

#### Delegation with DELEG

If the delegation has a DELEG RRset, the authoritative server MUST put DELEG RRset into the authority section of the referral. In this case server MUST NOT add NS RRset into the authority section. Presence of covering RRSIG follows DNSSEC specification for answers with authoritative zone data.

Similarly rules for DS RRset inclusion into referrals apply as specified by DNSSEC protocol without changes.

#### Delegation without DELEG

If the delegation does not have DELEG RRset, the authoritative server MUST put the NS RRset into the authority section of the referral. Absence of DELEG RRset must be proven as specified by DNSSEC protocol for authoritative data.

Similarly rules for DS RRset inclusion into referrals apply as specified by DNSSEC protocol without changes. Please note in practice the same process and records are used to prove non-existence of DELEG and DS RRsets.

The server MUST copy the DE bit from the query into the response.
(TODO: not really necessary protocol-wise, but might be nice for monitoring the deployment?)

## DNSSEC Signers

The DELEG record is authoritative on the parent side of a zone cut and needs to be signed as such. Existing rules from DNSSEC specification apply. In summary: For DNSSEC signing, treat DELEG RR type the same way as DS RR type.

In order to protect validators from downgrade attacks this draft introduces a new DNSKEY flag ADT (Authoritative Delegation Types). In zones which contain a DELEG RRset this flag MUST be set to one in at least one DNSKEYs published in the zone.

## DNSSEC Validators

DELEG awareness introduces additional requirements on validators.

### Clarifications on Nonexistence Proofs

This document updates {{!RFC6840}} section 4.1 to include "NS or DELEG" types in type bitmap as indication of a delegation point and generalizes applicability of Ancestor delegation proof to all types authoritative at parent (i.e. DS and DELEG). Updated text follows:

An "ancestor delegation" NSEC RR (or NSEC3 RR) is one with:

-  the NS and/or DELEG bit set,

-  the Start of Authority (SOA) bit clear, and

-  a signer field that is shorter than the owner name of the NSEC RR,
   or the original owner name for the NSEC3 RR.

Ancestor delegation NSEC or NSEC3 RRs MUST NOT be used to assume
nonexistence of any RRs below that zone cut, which include all RRs at
that (original) owner name other types authoritative at the parent-side of
zone cut (DS and DELEG), and all RRs below that owner name regardless of
type.

### Insecure Delegation Proofs

This document updates {{!RFC6840}} section 4.4 to include secure DELEG support and explicitly states Opt-Out is not applicable to DELEG. Updated text follows:

Section 5.2 of {{!RFC4035}} specifies that a validator, when proving a
delegation is not secure, needs to check for the absence of the DS
and SOA bits in the NSEC (or NSEC3) type bitmap.  The validator also
MUST check for the presence of the NS or DELEG bit in the matching NSEC (or
NSEC3) RR (proving that there is, indeed, a delegation).
Alternately make sure that the delegation with NS record is covered by an NSEC3
RR with the Opt-Out flag set. Opt-Out is not applicable to DELEG RR type
because this it is authoritative at the parent side of a zone cut in the same
say as DS RR type.

### Referral downgrade protection

When DNSKEY flag ADT is set to one, the DELEG aware validator MUST prove absence of a DELEG RRset in referral responses from this zone.

Without this check, an attacker could strip DELEG RRset from a referral response and replace it with an unsigned (and potentially malicious) NS RRset. A referral response with an unsigned NS and signed DS RRsets does not require additional proofs of nonexistance according to pre-DELEG DNSSEC specification and it would have been accepted as a delegation without DELEG RRset.

### Chaining

A Validating Stub Resolver that is DELEG aware has to use a Security-Aware Resolver that is DELEG aware and if it is behind a forwarder this has to be security and DELEG aware as well.

# IANA Considerations

IANA is requested to allocate the DELEG RR in the Resource Record (RR) TYPEs registry, with the meaning of "enhanced delegation information" and referencing this document.

IANA is requested to assign a new bit in the DNSKEY RR Flags registry ({{!RFC4034}}) for the ADT bit (N), with the description "Authoritative Delegation Types" and referencing this document. For compatibility reasons we request the bit 14 to be used. This value has been proven to work whereas bit 0 was proven to break in practical deployments (because of bugs).

IANA is requested to assign a bit from the EDNS Header Flags registry ({{!RFC6891}}), with the abbreviation DE, the description "DELEG enabled" and referencing this document.

IANA is requested to assign a value from the Extended DNS Error Codes ({{!RFC8914}}), with the Purpose "New Delegation Only" and referencing this document.

For the RDATA parameters to a DELEG RR, the DNS Service Bindings (SVCB) registry ({{!RFC9460}}) is used.  This document requests no new assignments to that registry, though it is expected that future DELEG work will.
